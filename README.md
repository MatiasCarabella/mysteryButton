### Problem
The date is March 20, 2015, you're a Reddit employee and you come up with an 'April Fools' prank: To create a section of the page containing a large button and a counter indicating a descending amount of seconds.

The counter descends from 60 seconds to 0 and only resets if someone with the page open presses the button. It can only be pressed once per user and when a user presses it a color is assigned as a reminder.

### Requirement
A single page application that implements the button idea considering the following aspects:
- The 'click' of the button is an irreversible action.
- The single page should be minimalistic.
- Since it is for a joke, nothing about how the button works should be explained explicitly.
- You can decide how much and what kind of contextual information to provide to the user.
- Simulate other people's clicks and have everything work offline _(with some standard random function)_.

### Extras
In addition, you can apply any of the following:

- Use Angular 7 as a framework. You can use Angular Material as UX library.
- Add visualizations for the different events that occur automatically.
- Add visualizations to indicate the user's color.
- Keep track of automatic clicks and show some statistics or related visualization.
